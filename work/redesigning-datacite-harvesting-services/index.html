        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Redesigned DataCite's Harvesting Services from the ground up to address underutilization and unlock untapped revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>DataCite's existing Harvester Services were significantly underutilized despite the fact that users of such services are typically willing to pay for them. We recognized an untapped revenue opportunity if we could boost service utilization through better understanding of user needs and improved service design.</p>
<p>The challenge was to understand why the current services weren't meeting user needs and redesign them to be more valuable and accessible to our target audience.</p>

<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2022</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>DataCite's Harvesting Services faced several critical challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low utilization rates</strong> despite market demand for harvesting services</li>
<li><strong>Unclear value proposition</strong> for potential paying customers</li>
<li><strong>Limited understanding</strong> of user needs and preferences</li>
<li><strong>Technical constraints</strong> that didn't align with user workflows</li>
<li><strong>Missed revenue opportunities</strong> in a market willing to pay for quality services</li>
</ul>
<p>The existing service architecture and user experience weren't meeting the diverse needs of organizations looking to harvest research data and metadata.</p>
<h2>Research Methodology</h2>
<h3>Focus Group Study</h3>
<p>We initiated the project with a comprehensive focus group study involving representatives from 10 major organizations. This exploratory approach allowed us to understand their needs in terms of harvesting services and their willingness to pay for such services.</p>
<p>The focus group provided critical insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current pain points with existing harvesting solutions</li>
<li>Preferred data formats and delivery methods</li>
<li>Pricing expectations and budget constraints</li>
<li>Technical requirements and integration needs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design Sprint Approach</h3>
<p>A design sprint was subsequently conducted to generate a comprehensive initial prototype for the new harvesting service. This sprint involved around 7 internal collaborators from different departments and was facilitated virtually using Miro due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The aim was to ensure that the service redesign would meet the needs of all organizational corners. To foster a long-term vision, we slightly altered the design sprint's activity order, positioning the mapping activity as a secondary step.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nzSRTi9.png" alt="Design Sprint - Mapping Process"></p>
<h2>Design Sprint Process</h2>
<h3>Day 1: Expert Interviews &amp; How Might We</h3>
<p>I prepared a bespoke questionnaire to guide participants during the &quot;expert interviews&quot; activity of the design sprint, which led to 83 &quot;how might we&quot; notes. This comprehensive collection of insights formed the foundation for our ideation process.</p>
<h3>Days 2-4: Mapping, Sketching, and Prototyping</h3>
<p>Over the next three days, I guided the participants through each stage of the design sprint, focusing significant effort on the mapping exercise and sketching day preparation.</p>
<p>Two top-voted sketches were selected for further prototyping in Figma, followed by an Expert Walkthrough validation with eight users to collect further feedback.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Through our research methodology, we identified six critical requirements for the redesigned harvesting service:</p>
<h3>Format Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Both XML and JSON</strong> need to be provided for different use cases, as organizations have varying technical infrastructures and preferences.</p>
<h3>Frequency Needs</h3>
<p><strong>Monthly and daily harvesting</strong> are of the essence for most users, with some requiring even more frequent updates for time-sensitive applications.</p>
<h3>Metadata Specifications</h3>
<p><strong>Most cases will need only metadata</strong> but citation data could be packaged separately, allowing for more flexible and cost-effective service tiers.</p>
<h3>Business Model</h3>
<p><strong>A tiered freemium approach</strong> is possible with a Premium service specifically designed for for-profit organizations willing to pay for enhanced features.</p>
<h3>Integration Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Tight integration with the DataCite CRM</strong> will be needed to provide seamless user management and billing capabilities.</p>
<h3>Snapshot Services</h3>
<p><strong>For-profits would prefer snapshots</strong> due to the high demands on frequency, providing complete datasets at specific points in time rather than incremental updates.</p>
<h2>Solution Architecture</h2>
<p>Based on our research findings, we developed a comprehensive solution that addressed all identified user needs:</p>
<h3>Tiered Service Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Tier</strong>: Free access to essential metadata harvesting</li>
<li><strong>Premium Tier</strong>: Enhanced features for commercial users including higher frequency updates, priority support, and additional data formats</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-format support</strong> for both XML and JSON outputs</li>
<li><strong>Flexible frequency options</strong> from daily to real-time updates</li>
<li><strong>Snapshot capabilities</strong> for complete dataset downloads</li>
<li><strong>API-first architecture</strong> for seamless integration</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Experience Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplified onboarding</strong> process for new users</li>
<li><strong>Self-service portal</strong> for managing harvesting preferences</li>
<li><strong>Clear documentation</strong> and support resources</li>
<li><strong>Transparent pricing</strong> and service level agreements</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact and Results</h2>
<p>The implementation of our research-driven recommendations delivered significant business impact:</p>
<h3>42% Reduction in Lead Time</h3>
<p>The findings scoped the design work sufficiently to start working on the MVP earlier and faster, accelerating time-to-market for the improved service.</p>
<h3>New Customer Relationships</h3>
<p>The implementation of these recommendations led to the establishment of relationships with <strong>four potential paying users</strong> of the harvesting service, representing significant revenue opportunities.</p>
<h3>Immediate User Adoption</h3>
<p>The introduction of the snapshot feature allowed <strong>12 new users</strong> to take advantage of the service right away, demonstrating immediate market validation.</p>
<h2>Stakeholder Testimonial</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When we were involved in the design sprint for the DataCite harvesting service, the 'How Might We' question technique supported creativity while focusing on the problem to solve for the user.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Britta Dreyer</strong><br>
Head of PID and Metadata Services, Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Insights and Recommendations</h2>
<p>Our research led to three key strategic recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Define a tiered approach</strong> for the harvesting service, including a basic service for users requiring only citation metadata and a premium service for others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modify the tech stack and user profile service</strong> to accommodate the new premium tier users and their specific requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale the infrastructure</strong> to address the increased needs for higher frequency harvesting and larger data volumes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The DataCite Harvesting Services redesign project demonstrates the power of user-centered design research in identifying and addressing service utilization challenges. By conducting comprehensive focus groups and design sprints, we were able to uncover specific user needs that weren't being met by the existing service.</p>
<p>The project successfully transformed an underutilized service into a viable revenue opportunity while better serving the research community's data harvesting needs. The tiered approach and technical improvements provide a sustainable foundation for future growth and service expansion.</p>
